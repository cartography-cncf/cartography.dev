We are thrilled to announce that Cartography has been accepted into the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) as a Sandbox project. This is a significant milestone for our community and reflects the growing importance of infrastructure visibility in the cloud native ecosystem.

## What This Means

Being part of the CNCF means Cartography joins a vibrant ecosystem of open source projects that are shaping the future of cloud native computing. It provides us with:

- **Vendor-neutral governance** — ensuring the project remains community-driven
- **Increased visibility** — reaching a broader audience of potential users and contributors
- **Community support** — access to CNCF resources and events

## Our Journey

Cartography started as an internal tool at Lyft, born from the need to understand complex infrastructure relationships and their security implications. Since being open-sourced, it has grown into a tool used by organizations worldwide.

## What's Next

We're committed to continuing to improve Cartography and grow our community. Expect more integrations, better performance, and enhanced visualization capabilities in the coming releases.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to making this possible!
